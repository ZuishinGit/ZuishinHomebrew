Their rough upbringing turned them to a life of crime, and eventually they became skilled assassins, who venture across Faerun to complete their contracts. Long ago, a clone of Manshoon helped them escape undermountain, and as such they owe him a great favor. While not members of Zhentarim, they consider themselves servants of Bane, and as such have alligned goals.",

					"Sen'Gar one day found a gross cyst growing from his neck, which eventually grew to the size of a fist. This is when it began to speak to him. The cyst offered great power in exchange for the spreading of their disease, to which Sen'Gar obliged. He uses vultures to spread quite horrifying magic diseases, the likes of which have never before been encountered in Faerun. Sen'Gar dons the skull of a giant vulture, and uses magical gases to manipulate wild animals. However, there is a particular flock of vultures that follows Sen'Gar, eating the trail of bodies he leaves in his wake."
